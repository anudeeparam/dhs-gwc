      <p> Hello and welcome to the first ever Duluth High School <a href= "https://girlswhocode.com/clubs/">GirlswhoCode club</a>!
        The mission is to provide motivated young women at our school with a free after-school program introducing them to the GWC sisterhood of peers and role models using computer science to change the world! You will learn fundamental concepts of computer science-- concepts that can be used in almost any field of work. GirlswhoCode will teach you all about loops, variables, conditionals and functions that form the basis for all programming languages. Not to mention, you will join a sisterhood of over 50,000 girls who have experienced GirlswhoCode, and are starting to see themselves as computer scientists!

      <p> Computing is the future... so why are girls being left out of it? It is 2018, and less than 20% of computer science graduates are women. GirlswhoCode is working to wage that gap so young women like YOU can make a creative and helpful impact on our advancing communities. The Duluth High School Girls who Code club is designed for students with a wide range of computer science experience. ZERO computer science knowledge is needed to join!
